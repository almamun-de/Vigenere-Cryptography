# How the Vigenère Cipher Works

## Overview

The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. It is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, which improves upon the Caesar cipher by using multiple shift values.

## Encryption Process

1. **Choose a Keyword**: Select a keyword that will be used to encrypt the message. The keyword should be a sequence of letters.

2. **Repeat the Keyword**: Extend the keyword to match the length of the plaintext. If the keyword is shorter than the plaintext, repeat it as many times as needed.

3. **Encrypt Each Letter**:
   - For each letter in the plaintext, find its corresponding letter in the extended keyword.
   - Shift the plaintext letter forward in the alphabet by the position value of the keyword letter.

4. **Example**:
   - **Plaintext**: HELLO
   - **Keyword**: KEY
   - **Extended Keyword**: KEYKE
   - **Encryption**:
     - H (shift by K) → R
     - E (shift by E) → I
     - L (shift by Y) → J
     - L (shift by K) → V
     - O (shift by E) → S
   - **Ciphertext**: RIJVS

## Decryption Process

1. **Use the Same Keyword**: To decrypt the ciphertext, use the same keyword that was used for encryption.

2. **Decrypt Each Letter**:
   - For each letter in the ciphertext, find its corresponding letter in the extended keyword.
   - Shift the ciphertext letter backward in the alphabet by the position value of the keyword letter.

3. **Example**:
   - **Ciphertext**: RIJVS
   - **Keyword**: KEY
   - **Extended Keyword**: KEYKE
   - **Decryption**:
     - R (shift back by K) → H
     - I (shift back by E) → E
     - J (shift back by Y) → L
     - V (shift back by K) → L
     - S (shift back by E) → O
   - **Plaintext**: HELLO

## Additional Information

- **Key Points**:
  - The Vigenère cipher is stronger than the Caesar cipher but can still be vulnerable to frequency analysis, especially with shorter keywords.
  - Modern cryptography has advanced beyond the Vigenère cipher, but it remains an important historical encryption technique.
